  perfect_match: `I can sense the anger in your words. The Handbook of Spiritual Medicine directly addresses this as 'ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ∂ÿ®' (Anger). On page 32, it explains:

"Due to your anger, and that of another, a quarrel is stirred and heated to the point of conflict"

In your situation with your coworkers, this means that your anger can escalate conflicts unnecessarily. The Handbook suggests controlling anger by recognizing that nothing happens without Allah's permission. As mentioned on page 33: "You repel or keep your anger under control by recognising that nothing takes place without the leave of Allah"

üìö **References from A Handbook of Spiritual Medicine:**
‚Ä¢ Page 32: "Due to your anger, and that of another, a quarrel is stirred and heated to the point of conflict"
‚Ä¢ Page 33: "You repel or keep your anger under control by recognising that nothing takes place without the leave of Allah"

üîç **Related Topic:** Anger (ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ∂ÿ®)
üìñ **Chapter:** Pages 30-42`,

  related_theme: `What you're describing - frequent outbursts of anger - is something the Handbook discusses in detail. Page 32 states:

"Due to your anger, and that of another, a quarrel is stirred and heated to the point of conflict"

The document explains this typically happens because of lack of patience and self-control. The recommended approach, as outlined on page 33, is: "You repel or keep your anger under control by recognising that nothing takes place without the leave of Allah"`,

  general_guidance: `Your situation reminds me of the wisdom shared in the Handbook's chapter on patience. While not identical to your case, page 35 offers relevant guidance:

"Patience in adversity brings peace to the heart"

Applying this to your circumstances suggests taking time for reflection and prayer. The Handbook emphasizes on page 36: "Through remembrance of Allah, hearts find rest"`,

  no_direct_match: `The Handbook doesn't specifically address this exact situation. However, based on what you've shared about feeling overwhelmed, and considering the overall principles of spiritual wellness discussed throughout the document, I encourage you to seek comfort in prayer and remembrance of Allah.

If you'd like, I can share what the Handbook says about finding peace during difficult times which might offer some relevant insights.`
